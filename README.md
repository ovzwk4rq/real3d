# real3d
This project was to create a real 3d space using a very minimal graphic library. It uses a graphic library made by our school, so you cannot execute it.  
Anyway, let me give you a rough explanation of what this project was.  
When executed, you see a space with randomly placed cubes with same sizes. With arrow keys, you can turn around in any direction and you can move forword, backward, left and right using WASD keys.  
Sadly the program was so slow and I lost my interest.
